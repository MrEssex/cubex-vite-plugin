# Cubex Vite Plugin

## Introduction

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a modern frontend tool that delivers an extremely fast development experience. It
includes features like lightning-fast cold server start, instant hot module replacement, and optimized builds for
production.

This plugin integrates Vite into Cubex to provide a seamless development experience.

This project is a modified version of
the [CodeIgniter Vite Plugin](https://github.com/monster010/codeigniter-vite-plugin)
which in turn is based on the [Laravel Vite Plugin](https://github.com/laravel/vite-plugin)

## Installation
